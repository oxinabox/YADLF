	so please find attached my attempt at the presentation format / style
	for the literature review. Note that a proposal is not a conference
	publication but the idea is the same: - introduce the area and highlight
	the issues/problems/aspects relevant to what you will investigate
	- present a review of the literature as an overview of different
	paradigms highlighting the conceptual differences without getting
	bogged down with specific equations which detract. Do include diagrams
	and key equations though to demonstrate you understand what you are
	talking about! - highlight any weakness or strengths from the previously
	published research to date - introduce your aims/plan as arising
	or connected to the weaknesses/strengths you have highlighted to
	justify your choice of methods/techniques - in the methodology use
	the literature to govern the experimental - protocols that apply
	within the confines of the data or software you have access to},
